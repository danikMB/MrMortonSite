          <h2>Jon's Career</h2>
          <p>
            I've always known Jon to be an active person. I remember Jon could
            not stop playing with the things around him when he was younger.
            Now, he still struggles with controlling this burst of energy so he
            busts it out by watching too much skibidi toilet on his IPad Pro.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most teachers choose their job to improve the lives of young
            children. Jon chose this career only for the young children.
            Although desperate to be working in the prep school, unfortunately
            he became the head of the dihpartment at college. Upset with this
            outcome, Jon still made his best effort to try and find a way to
            pleasure himself by luring innocent asian children to follow him
            around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sigma as he is and having consumed all the innocence out of the
            current college, Jon decided to move on and find some unexplored
            fine shyts in Bedales. His looksmaxxing ability would give him all
            the potential to bag the chuzz in there, so we wish him luck.

          <h2>Mystery Riddle (Only legends can solve this)</h2>
          <p>
            There were 3 people in a bar on a Friday night. Person 1 says, "I've
            gyatt to go home". Person 2 says, "What is this Ohio?". Person 3
            moans out, "Sybau huzz". Then, a strange man enters a bar, wearing a
            black hat. He goes up to approach the 3 people, but then he
            instantly walks off. Why?
          </p>
          <p><b>A)</b> He notices that they are police men</p>
          <p><b>B)</b> He is in a hurry</p>
          <p><b>C)</b> He forgot his keys at home</p>
          <p>
            <b>D)</b> The 3 people are 18 years old (7 years too old for the
            man's preferences)

        <h3>Dear, Mr Morton</h3>

        <p>
          As a class, we wanted to take a moment to express our sincere
          gratitude for everything you've done throughout this year. Your
          dedication, passion, and patience have made a significant impact on
          our understanding of computer science, and we truly appreciate all the
          time and effort you've invested in helping us succeed. Your lessons
          have not only deepened our knowledge of programming and algorithms but
          have also sparked a genuine interest in the field that many of us
          didnâ€™t have before. You've made even the most challenging topics feel
          more approachable and have encouraged us to push ourselves beyond our
          limits. We're grateful for the encouragement and support you've
          provided, especially during the more difficult moments. Thank you for
          fostering such an engaging and inclusive learning environment. You've
          made computer science a subject we look forward to studying, and we
          feel more confident in our skills because of your guidance. Once
          again, thank you for being such a wonderful teacher. We look forward
          to applying everything we've learned in future projects and classes.
        </p>
